# STM32-nRF24L01_Blink
stm32f103 receives a signal through a nrf24l01 radio to turn on or off an LED. see repository beadone/pi_nrf24l01_rxtx_mqtt 
for transmit code.
The code works but is primative and the configuration is hard coded into the program
it is based on the rf24 library and the stm32 library from Roger Clarke
